# Ex.No:8(C) FILTER READER
## AIM:
 To create a java Program to read the content from the file by using Filter Reader 


## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program
2.  Define CustomFilterReader1, extending FilterReader, and override the read() method to replace spaces with $ while reading.
2.	In main(), create a FileOutputStream and a FilterOutputStream to write "India is my country" to a file named javaFile123.txt.
3.	Write the string to the file using filter.write(), then close the FilterOutputStream.
4.	Create a FileReader to read from javaFile123.txt, and wrap it with CustomFilterReader1.
5.	Read and print each character, where spaces are replaced with $, until the end of the file.
6.	Close CustomFilterReader1 and FileReader to free resources
