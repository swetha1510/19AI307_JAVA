## AIM:
To create a java program to append a string in a file “testout.txt” using Writer.

## ALGORITHM :

2.	It reopens the file in append mode and adds "Hi Everybody" at the end of the existing content.
3.	It reads the file's content (Welcome to Java File Concept -Reader1234567890) and displays it.
4.	The file is deleted using file.delete().
5.	It tries to read the file again, but this throws an exception since the file no longer exists.
