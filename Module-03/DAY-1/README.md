# Ex.No:3(A)  STRING AND ITS OPERATIONS IN JAVA
## AIM:
To create a java program to read input and print length of the string in java.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program.
2.	Import `Scanner` and define class `demo`
3.	In `main`:
-	a) Create `Scanner` object `sc`
-	b) Read a line of text into `String` variable `str`
4.	Print "The size of the String is " + `str.length()`
5.	End


## PROGRAM:
